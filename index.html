        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle" target="_blank">Aristotle</a> 
            (384–322 B.C.E.) numbers among the greatest philosophers of all time. 
            Judged solely in terms of his philosophical influence, 
            only Plato is his peer: Aristotle’s works shaped centuries of 
            philosophy from Late Antiquity through the Renaissance, and 
            even today continue to be studied with keen, non-antiquarian 
            interest. A prodigious researcher and writer, Aristotle left 
            a great body of work, perhaps numbering as many as two-hundred 
            treatises, from which approximately thirty-one survive.[1] His 
            extant writings span a wide range of disciplines, from logic, 
            metaphysics and philosophy of mind, through ethics, political 
            theory, aesthetics and rhetoric, and into such primarily 
            non-philosophical fields as empirical biology, where he 
            excelled at detailed plant and animal observation and 
            description. In all these areas, Aristotle’s theories 
            have provided illumination, met with resistance, sparked debate, 
            and generally stimulated the sustained interest of an abiding 
            readership.</p>

        <p>Because of its wide range and its remoteness in time, Aristotle’s 
            philosophy defies easy encapsulation. The long history of interpretation
            and appropriation of Aristotelian texts and themes—spanning over two 
            millennia and comprising philosophers working within a variety of 
            religious and secular traditions—has rendered even basic points of 
            interpretation controversial. The set of entries on Aristotle in this
            site addresses this situation by proceeding in three tiers. First,
            the present, general entry offers a brief account of Aristotle’s 
            life and characterizes his central philosophical commitments, 
            highlighting his most distinctive methods and most influential 
            achievements.[2] Second are General Topics, which offer detailed 
            introductions to the main areas of Aristotle’s philosophical activity.
                Finally, there follow Special Topics, which investigate in greater
                detail more narrowly focused issues, especially those of central
                concern in recent Aristotelian scholarship.</p>
